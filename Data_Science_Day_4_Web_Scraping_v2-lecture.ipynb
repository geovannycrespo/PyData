If I figured there was good odds of living happily ever after, I might. But such questions are answered not just by deliberation, they're affected by emotion. Love can blind us to logic, reason and common sense.

It's sort of a \"patting oneself on the back\" to say it, but I wish more people would show restraint about forming intimate relationships of the sort that are called marriages.
